## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kabeermak88/Age-and-Gender-Detection.git
   cd Age-and-Gender-Detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**  
   (Recommended so that dependencies don't mess up your system Python)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **MacOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the main script (example, depending on how you set up):
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
   *(adjust the filename if needed)*
